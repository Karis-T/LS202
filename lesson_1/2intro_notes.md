### What am I supposed to focus on?

- Few people are an expert on HTML and CSS but you should be proficient enough to be able to built attractive webpages either from scratch or with a design.
- Use the guides below to focus your studies and practice:

1. **What is Vocabulary and why is it important?**
   - Most terms are easy enough to learn compared to other languages. Here are the ones you should know:
     - Element
     - tag (including self closing ones)
     - Document type definition (DOCTYPE, DTD)
     - attributes
     - selector
     - property
     - id, class & name

2. **What is the difference between HTML and CSS?**
   - HTML structures the content of the webpage
   - CSS describes the appearance / presentation of the page
   - There is some overlap where HTML and CSS handle each other's tasks.
3. **Why is HTML and CSS syntax important?**
   - While HTML and CSS syntax is simple, try to focus on how to put items together as opposed to what each property, selector, attribute or tag does.
4. **Why is the structure of a webpage important?**
   - A basic boilerplate made up of `DOCTYPE` <html> <head> <body> , and some other <head> tags is the conventional code used to define the basic layout of a webpage. Understand how template works. 
5. **What are Basic HTML Elements?**
   - Don't try to learn it all, you probably would never be able to. The best way to understand HTML is to practice it, and therefore won't need to keep referring to documentation.
     - < a > :anchors contain links to other webpages
     - < p > : paragraphs are the standard way to organize / construct web pages
     - < h1 >  to < h6 >: headings for webpages
     - < em > and < strong >
     - < header > and < main >
     - < article > and < section > and < aside >
     - < div > and < span >

6. **How do we use CSS with HTML?**
   - there are 3 ways to use CSS within HTML:
     1. inline
     2. internal: < style > tags add internal CSS

7. **What are basic CSS Selectors?**
   - CSS has 3 kinds of selectors:
     1. <u>id</u> selects id attribute
     2. <u>class</u> selects class attribute
     3. <u>tag</u> selects tag name
   - don't get too caught up in how to combine them just learn the syntax
8. **What are CSS properties?**
   - don't get too caught up in trying to remember all the properties. Consult the documentation where needed. The most important ones are:
     - color
     - background-color
     - font-family
     - font-size
9. **Why is using the browser's inspector important?**
