## HTML

>- HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language.
>- HTML uses markup to organize your content and give it semantic meaning.
>- Elements are the basic building blocks of HTML.
>- We use tags in HTML to represent elements.
>- Tags may have attributes that add details to the element.
>- The Document Type Definition (DTD or DOCTYPE) tells the browser what subset of HTML you intend to use.
>- All documents require a DOCTYPE.
>- All documents should have `html`, `head`, `title`, and `body` tags, and should also include a `meta` tag that defines the character set. The standard does not require these tags, but always using them will keep you out of trouble.
>- HTML attributes `id`, `class`, and `name` assign different kinds of identification information to HTML elements.

- The `p`, `a`, `em`, `strong`, and `h1`..`h6` tags; you should memorize these. You should also be familiar with the `header`, `main`, `article`, `section`, `aside`, `div` and `span` tags, but you don't have to recognize them yet; you will through repeated use, though.

## CSS

- CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets.
- CSS tells your browser how to present content with spacing, colors, sizing, font styles, background images, placement, and much more.
- CSS properties have a name and value.
- CSS rules have a selector that describes what elements to style and a list of zero or more properties that define how the browser should render them.
  - CSS tag selectors select HTML elements by element (tag) name, e.g., `h1`
  - CSS class selectors select HTML elements by class name. The selector consists of a `.` followed by the class name, e.g., `.highlight`.
  - CSS ID selectors select HTML elements by ID name. The selector consists of a `#` followed by the ID, e.g., `#intro`.
  - You can concatenate CSS selectors to make them more specific, e.g., `strong.highlight`.
- CSS has both specificity and inheritance rules that control the notion of the cascade; together, these rules define how CSS rules with different selectors interact.
- CSS font stacks tell the browser which font to use by providing a list of candidate fonts along with an optional "fallback" font family.
- The difference between serif and sans-serif fonts.
- The differences, benefits, and problems with inline, internal, and external CSS.
- How to set text and background colors, font families, and font sizes.
