### Do I have to Master HTML and CSS?

- HTML displays content. But it was crude and inconsistent across browsers. Much of that has been mitigated today thanks to the help of CSS, which aids in the consistent appearance of HTML elements from platform to platform.
- HTML is essential for front end jobs but not software engineering- It's not required. Therefore there's no LS assessment. Still try to master the material but don't get too hung up on everything. It's better to **be familiar HTML & CSS** than get too caught up in the details.

### Where do I find more info about HTML and CSS?

- Only the most used parts on HTML and CSS will be covered in the course. A lot will be omitted. You only really need to learn about a feature when you're going to use it. Be expected to lookup information that won't be taught to you using the following sites:
  - Asking a question on Google will be your best asset eg. "How do I make superscripts in html?"  also begin questions with mdn (mozilla developer network) or w3c (world wide web Consortium) to gain more authoritative feedback. 
    - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/): probably the most concise resource for all HTML CSS and Javascript information. You will likely find a lot answers to your questions here as they are up to date, generally accurate and its easy to use.
    - [W3C](http://www.w3.org/): The official documentation for HTML and CSS. While the information is quite dry and academic, it shouldn't be ignored as its still a valuable resource. 
    - [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) standards can be found at the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) who works in collaboration with W3C.  

>note: If you omit `mdn` or `w3c` from your search you'll probably come across W3 schools. Information on this site is often outdated and unreliable and should not be consulted as a authoritative resource.
