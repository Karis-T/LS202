## Introduction

This lesson covers fundamental CSS concepts including: the Box model, different types of display objects and dimensions and spacing.

### What should I know about testing and validation?

From this point forward LS will not be advising to check your code. There are 6 steps to code flow:

1. Update your code
2. Test the results in the browser
3. Validate HTML
4. Validate CSS
5. Check your page on another browser (periodically)*
6. Repeat

If you app is intended to work cross platforms you must check them on multiple platforms. It can be difficult to find the cause of an issue when you finish a project so try to catch problems early.

### What optional Software Should I know about?

The Google Chrome addon [Pesticide](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome-with/eipbgplchlidkojmppclhkechkhmlefi?hl=en) shows you how the box model interacts live on a page, including margins and padding.

### What should I focus on this lesson?

The box model is the most crucial part to understanding HTML and CSS and being a strong web developer. Pay attention to this lesson and read it several times.

#### What Vocab do I need to know?

You should be able to explain the following topics pretty clearly:

1. The box model:
   - Box Properties:
     - `width` and `height`
     - `padding` and `margin`
     - `border`
   - visual display models
     - `block`
     - `inline`
     - `inline-block`
   - box sizing model
     - `content-box`
     - `border-box`
2. dimensions
   - absolute units
   - relative units
3. be familiar with these terms but are not required to discuss in detail:
   - container
   - physical pixels
   - CSS reference pixels

#### What are Box Properties?

Box properties consist of:

- `height`
- `width`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `margin`

The visual display model interacts with each of these properties and you can set the padding, borders and margins to left, right, top and bottom. There are shortcuts to help you with this. 

#### What are Visual Display Models?

Visual Display Models come in 3 variations: `inline`, `block` and `inline-block`. Containers are mostly `block` elements while non-containers are `inline`. Check mdn if in doubt. There's no need to memorize which elements are blocks or inline. Learn how to change an element's visual display mode.

#### What are Box Sizing Models?

Box sizing models comes in 2 variations: `content-box` and `border-box`. Learn how and when you can change the box-sizing model for an element.

#### What should I know about Dimensions?

You should have a good understanding of the differences between `px` `em` `rem` `%` and `auto`. You'll also need to have a general idea of CSS reference pixels vs physical pixels. You'll also need to gain an understanding of how to center block elements horizontally using `auto`.

#### What should I know about HTML?

You don't have to memorize any new HTML elements discovered in this lesson

#### What should I know about CSS?

You should be able to memorize this list of properties so you can lookup their details:

- `display`
- `box-sizing`
- `width`
- `height`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `margin`

#### Why should I try the Examples?

typing the code develops muscle memory. Try not to copy and paste them

#### Why should I use the Documentation?

Get familiar using the documentation with regard to HTML / CSS elements, selectors and properties. Often they won't tell you how each of them works but you should be able to locate them.

#### Why should I study from the summary? 

You'll need to review it to make sure the terminology is mastered before moving on
