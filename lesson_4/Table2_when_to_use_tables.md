### When to use tables

Before CSS existed, tables were used to create webpage layouts. They had banners on top of the page, footer at the bottom and columns with content, navigation and ads. It was a workaround as **tables are intended for tabular data only;** when there is a specific need for horizontal and vertical data. eg. multiplication tables

This called for a new way of structuring layouts which led to CSS and eventually flex and grid box.
