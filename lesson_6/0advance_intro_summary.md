## Introduction

When it comes to layouts, instead of making HTML changes to hundreds of webpages moving one element to another part of the page, you can use the CSS file to make the change. 

You can also use CSS to position elements in different locations when the size of the screen changes. This allows it to be responsive to different mobile devices.

This lesson teaches you how to position and layout items on a webpage - ie. tell the browser where to place each element. In principle this is simple but its one of the hardest CSS topics.

know the layout-related features of CSS:

- floats
  - floated elements and how to clear floats
- positioning
  - using `position: absolute`
- flex
- grid
- liquid vs fluid layouts
- CSS frameworks
- responsive design
  - media queries

None of these topics are easy and are not expected to be mastered in this lesson

Familiarize yourself with the concepts and use google and mdn when you need to use them. Master previous lessons but only use advanced layouts when you're ready to use it. More experience is needed to grasp the subject so don't spend time struggling.
