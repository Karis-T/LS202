## Blink Comparisons

1. Take the designer file (typically a png) and load it into a HTML: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Design File</title>
    <style>
      body, img {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="design-file.png" alt="design file" /><!-- this img -->
  </body>
</html>
```

2. Load it into a browser
3. set the width and height of browser to match width and height of png file
4. Create HTML file and load it into a separate tab
5. Toggle browser back and forth (Ctrl-Tab and Shift-Ctrl-Tab)
6. spot the differences between design files and your working HTML. Make corrections
7. Return to step 5 until it matches as good as possible.

Note: You probably wont be able to get a perfect duplicate of the design just try to get as close as you can. Get as much of the project done as possible before turning to a blink comparision.
