## Steps to building a webpage from a design file

1. Determine the HTML needed to recreate the design. You can do this by identifying the major components of the page: 

   - headers
   - footers
   - main content areas
   - sections
   - asides
   - navigation
   - headings
   - paragraphs
   - etc.

2. Build an initial copy of the HTML without styles. The focus in this step is to use semantic HTML so the document structure makes sense

3. Work on the CSS. Developers usually start with:

   - The page background
   - default fonts
   - colors used
   - general placement of components
   - if using grid or flexbox consider the columns and rows and what elements go where

   The goal here is to create the approximate final look

4. Once the main parts are there focus on the details such as:

   - paddings
   - margins
   - borders
   - positioning
   - etc.
